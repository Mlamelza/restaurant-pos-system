## Description

A fully-functional point-of-sale-system created for the Vittles Restaurant Group. This web application was created with the employee in mind, ranging from the hourly to salaried management positions. This system allows users to log in with their unique credentials, create customer order transactions, manage inventory levels, track menu item details, and edit employee information. The front-end environment was designed utilizing the Bootstrap architecture module, while the back-end took advantage of the LAMP stack structure model. The application consists of a streamlined aesthetic feel, with a simple, yet effective, color palette.
